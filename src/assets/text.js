export const aboutMe = 'I am a reformed lawyer and former math teacher who now works in back-end development. I abstract processes, datasets, problems, and other project elements into workable representations so that they can be meaningfully worked on. From my days as an educator I will always carry with me the joy of learning how others work on the tasks in front of them so that I can continually learn new approaches to complex problems.'
